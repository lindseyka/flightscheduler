## About

Flight Scheduler is a comprehensive, user-friendly website and application that can be used on all platforms in order to streamline the flight scheduling process at military units, flight schools, and FBOs. Major features include being able to view the current schedule from anywhere (schedule is in the cloud), request flights, let your unit scheduler know of an upcoming flight physical or other appointment. Schedule can be viewed in multiple formats (day/week/month), or you can view just your own individual schedule. Get notifications pushed to your device when any changes that affect you are made, so you are never blindsided again.

Unit/Company schedulers and approval authorities will find Flight Scheduler significantly decreases their workload while increasing ease of access. Unique user permissions allow authorized personnel to view/approve schedule requests, and push out new schedules to whole units or individual affected crewmembers. Schedule is stored in the cloud for redundancy, and can be set to automatically backup to an offline server for ultimate security. Give it a try today - Flight Scheduler will always be free and fully-featured.
